Show that the line through the points \brak{4,7,8},\brak{2,3,4} is parallel to the line through the points\brak{-1,-2,1},\brak{1,2,5}.

\textbf{Solution :}
For line passing through \brak{4,7,8},\brak{2,3,4},the direction vector,\begin{align}
    \vec{m_1}&=\myvec{-2\\-4\\-4}
\end{align}
For line passing through \brak{-1,-2,1},\brak{1,2,5},the direction vector,\begin{align}
    \vec{m_2}&=\myvec{2\\4\\4}
\end{align}
Therefore,the lines are parallel to each other.
